Once in a lonely lifetime
I found a love that true
How could I go on living
Without you?
You take away my sorrow
With everything you do
How could I face tomorrow
Without you?
Without you in my life
Who'd be there to hold me tight?
Without you in my life
Who'd be there to kiss
goodnight?
I would cry
If you said goodbye
Can't live my life
Without you
I'd be blue
If you said we're through
What would I do
Without you?
You give my life a meaning
A reason to believe
Now what would I believe in
Without you
You are the sun each morning
You are the air I breathe
How could my would keep turning
Without you?
Without you in my life
I would never be the same
Without you In my life
I would never dream again
I would cry
If you said goodbye
Can't live my life
Without you
I'd be blue
If you said we're through
What would I do
Without you?
I would cry
If you said goodbye
Can't live my life
Without you
I'd be blue
If you said we're through
What would I do
Without you?
Without you?
