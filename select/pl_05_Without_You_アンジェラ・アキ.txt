I've been feeling lost without you
I'm looking for a way to make it up to you
I'm doing the best I can
I've been feeling lost without you
I should have loved you better, maybe you knew
I was doing the best I could
Can't remember how things started
Why and when I made you feel downhearted
Can't remember simple details
All the lies you told me
I think about you
You know I dream a lot about you
And all the little things that you do
You know I think a lot about you
But it's all in the past for me
Can't remember how things ended
Why a broken heart cannot be mended
Can't remember simple logic
All the jokes I told you
I think about you
You know I dream a lot about you
And all the little things that you do
You know I think a lot about you
But it's all in the past for me
Can't remember
Can't remember
Can't remember
What I wanted
Can't remember
Can't remember
Can't remember
Where I'm going
Can't remember...
I've been feeling lost without you
I'm looking for a way to make it up to you
I'm doing the best I can
I've been feeling lost without you
I should have loved you better,
you couldn't know
I was doing the best I could
Can't remember first impressions
Everything you did to make me happy
Can't remember how you kissed me
Wish we could start over
I think about you
You know I dream a lot about you
And all the little things that you do
You know I think a lot about you
But it's all in the past for me
Can't remember
Can't remember
Can't remember
What I wanted
Can't remember
Can't remember
Can't remember
Where I'm going
Can't remember...
I've been feeling lost without you
I'm looking for a way to make it up to you
I'm doing the best I can
I've been feeling lost without you
I should have loved you better, maybe you knew
I was doing the best I could
