I saw you
Right to you
Control me
Come over me
One look from you
You'd see me right through
Come closer please for
I'm a sight for sore eyes
I'm through

'Cause i'm falling without you
Crawling about you
Stalling without you here now
And though you're walking away
I still want you to stay
'Cause i'm falling without you
Here now

Away and through
If i can't have you
I'll tell myself i'll be ok
Another day or two
And while i'll try
I'll see the look in your eyes
Come back to what you know
I'll be waiting for you

'Cause i'm falling without you
Crawling about you
Stalling without you here now
And though you're walking away
I still want you to stay
'Cause i'm falling without you
Here now

'Cause all i ever really want is you
Is there nothing i can do?
Nothing i can say?

Cause i'm falling without you
Crawling about you
Stalling without you
Falling without you
Crawling about you
Stalling without you
Falling without you
Crawling about you

And though you're walking away
I still want you to stay
'Cause i'm falling without you
Here now
