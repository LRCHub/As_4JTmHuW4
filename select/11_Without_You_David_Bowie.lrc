[00:38.57] Just when the best things in life are gone
[00:45.69] I look into your eyes
[00:50.90] There's no smoke without fire
[00:54.21] You're exactly who I want to be with
[00:59.32] Without you

[01:40.61] And when I'm willing to call it a day
[01:48.79] Just when I won't take another chance
[01:56.87] I hold your hand
[02:01.46] There's no smoke without fire
[02:05.04] Woman I love you
[02:09.51] Without you
[02:14.88] What would I do
