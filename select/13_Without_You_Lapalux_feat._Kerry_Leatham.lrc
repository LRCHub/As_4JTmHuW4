[00:11.48] Right you by force to suck you in
[00:17.85] To pull you under
[00:24.99] Tight
[00:27.49] 
[00:31.54] And your words are engraved in me
[00:42.47] So long as guilt resides here
[00:56.97] 
[00:55.96] Come to the walls and writing
[01:05.95] Without broken hearts imprinted beside me
[01:26.45] 
[01:17.93] I do not want you to leave me
[01:28.65] I do not want to leave you
[01:39.74] I do not want you to leave me
[01:50.71] I do not want to leave you
